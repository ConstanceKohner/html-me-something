                    <p>This is me (and my little brother, pictured left) back in the 90s. I don't remember a time when we didn't have a computer in the house.</p>
                    <p>As a child, I was interested in science and tech (and loved playing video games), so it was almost a default assumption that I would go into a STEM field later in life.</p>
                    <p>I even went to a Girl Scout event called <a href="http://pathwaystopolitics.tripod.com/about/destinations/2004/summaries/science/index.html#extreme">"Extreme Science Careers"</a> where they flew 24 girls from across the US to New York for a week-long workshop.</p>

                    <h2>Secondary Education</h1>

                    <p>Unfortunately, my plans for a STEM career were tossed out the window at this stage, as my high school's STEM classes and opportunities paled in comparison with its English and psychology offerings.  Unsurprisingly, I decided to pursue a career path based on what I loved to study most.</p>
                    <p>I continued to pursue my interest in computer programming, though.  I attempted to organize the production of an indie game with a small group of friends, and I coded several scenes of character interaction and exposition. However, my friends weren't nearly as serious about the endevour as I was, and we decided that it would be best to let the project die.</p>
                    <p>My father tried to convince me to go back to school and become an engineer, but I hesistated at the thought of how many years of schooling that would take and dealing with the inevitable student debt. (I am extremely debt-averse.)</p>

                    <h2>Certified Pharmacy Technician</h1>
                    <img src="images/pharmacy.png" alt="Photo of Pharmacist, Shutterstock" title="Photo of Pharmacist, Shutterstock"/>
                    <p>I found a training program that I could afford outright, a pharmacy technician training program at a local community college. I knew that it was an underserved field, and the thought of helping others appealed to me.</p>
                    <p>Once I finished my certification test, I found a full-time position within convenient commutting distance. The work was very demanding but it was also rewarding to know that I was helping others.</p>
                    <p>However, community pharmacy suffers from a majot issue: The software is very outdated and difficult to work with. In rare cases, software error can even endanger patients. The more I thought about it, the more I began to feel like I was in the wrong field.</p>
                    <p>On the recommendation of friends and family, I looked into LaunchCode, and I subscribed to their newsletter. I bought a new laptop and patiently waited for enrollment to open for the LC101 night class.</p>

                    <h2>The Present</h1>

                    <p>Even better, LaunchCode announced that they would be starting a new program called "Immersive CodeCamp" based on their LC101 curriculum.</p>
                    <p>I applied and while working through the preliminary work for the program, found that their online lessons 'clicked' better than any programming self-study that I had previously done.</p>
                    <p>Coincidentally, the first class session was on my birthday. You could say that an opportunity to embark on this exciting new career path is the best present I've ever received.</p>
